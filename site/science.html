        <h2>My Science</h2>
        <br />
        <p>I completed my doctorate in Chemistry in 2011 at the University of Bath under
          <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/chemistry/contacts/academics/karen_edler/" class="link">Dr. Karen Edler</a>. Prior to this I was awarded a MChem in Chemistry with North American Study from the University
          of Bath, although this was started at the University of Exeter. My North American study year was completed at the
          University of Southern Mississippi.</p>
        <p>My doctoral thesis was titled
          <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Nanostructured hydrogel films for encapsulation and release"</span> and is freely availale on the
          <a href="http://opus.bath.ac.uk/27931/" class="link">University of Bath Website.</a>
        </p>
        <div id="accordion">

          <div>
            <p>We have been investigating solutions of surfactants and polyelectrolytes that are able to spontaneously form
              micron thick hydrogel films at the air/solution interface. Previous research within the group has shown that
              the surfactant can act as a templating agent for the polymer hydrogel, leading to well ordered mesostructured
              films similar to those seen in surfactant templated inorganic materials or polymeric layer-by-layer films,
              which have both been highly active areas of research over the past 20 years. This project built on the previous
              research within the group to develop a greater understanding of these films and how they may be controlled
              and used for real world applications.</p>
            <p>This thesis concentrates on two areas; the first is films made from a cationic surfactant/polymer system and
              the second from a cat-anionic surfactant/polymer system. Using the cationic surfactant/polymer system, we built
              on the previous research by altering the head group area to tail volume ratio of the surfactants being used
              to allow control over the final mesostructure within the films. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used
              to study the bulk solution while neutron and x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence diffraction were used
              to study the films. Using this system we have also developed the previous work, studying the incorporation
              of sparingly soluble species in films, by studying the encapsulation of hydrophobic and amphiphilic species
              into the surfactant micelles and therefore into the films as a function of micelle and film structure. We have
              also studied, using Fluorescence spectroscopy, the subsequent release of these species from the films.</p>
            <p>The cat-anionic surfactant/polymer system was discovered more recently and therefore has not had as much previous
              research performed on it. It is of particular interest because it allows films to be formed from a variety
              of different polymers where the cationic system currently has only been found to form films with one polymer.
              Using this cat-anionic system we have studied the surfactant interactions in the bulk with SANS, ultra-SANS
              and spin-echo-SANS to determine the structure over a wide length range. This data is compared to cryo-SEM results.
              In particular cryo-SEM and USANS have been used to validate modelling from the new technique of SESANS. We
              then studied the film formation with x-ray and neutron reflectivity. As well as forming from a wider range
              of polymers, these films are much thicker and more robust, which may be due to the larger scale aggregates
              formed in solution.</p>

        <h3>Websites listing my publications</h3>
        <p>
          As I am not actively pursuing a scientific career I am not publishing and am not keeping a list of the publications I am
          featured on. There are projects I have been involved in that I am aware contain unpublished work, as this becomes
          published the following resources would be updated faster than a list I create.
