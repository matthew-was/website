                <h1>The Complete Web Developer Course</h1>
                <p>The first six sections were completed under the first version of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/" class="link">The Complete WebDeveloper Course</a>. This was superseded by <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/">The Complete Web Developer Course 2</a>. As of March 16 2016 I transfered onto version 2 of the course to learn PHP and onwards, including the final three sections showsn below which were not available in version 1. I will go back and double check the first 6 sections to check if I have missed anything</p>
                <p>As with the Python course this course was complimented by my previous knowledge and work I had done on <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>This course started slowly but quickly ramped up into areas I had only passing knowledge about, namely some parts of jQuery, AJAX, regex in a website, Twitter Bootstrap and Wordpress. I am still working my way through this course studying PHP with the further modules detailed below to be completed in due course. Each completed item contains a link to the end of section project. The HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery Project are very similar to the course projects, although usually completed in advance of watching the video. The Bootstrap was based on the course but of my own design. The Wordpress site is entirely mine and has been developed for a client (as of March 16th 2016 this site is still under development). As second bootstrap page is in production for a second client who also requires eCommerce.</p>
