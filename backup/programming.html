                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <h3>Early Career</h3>
                <p>My initial knowledge of programming was in HTML and CSS in the mid '90s. At the time programming as a career was never made obvious to me otherwise things might be very different today.During my time at University as an undergraduate I became aware of more programming languages and was first introduced to Fortran77 and Fortran 95. It was during my doctorate that my interest in programming was rekindled with basic knowledge of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>, <a class="link" href="http://wavemetrics.com/">IgorPro</a>, <a class="link" href="https://certif.com/spec.html">SPEC</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
                <p>During my postdoctoral work, still based in science, I learnt more about Bash and Python, in the form of <a class="link" href="http://www.sasview.org/">SASView</a> and was introduced to Java and C, although only in passing including discussions on adapting the fitting routines in <a class="link" href="http://www.sasview.org/">SASView</a> to C and CUDA to allow data fitting using GPGPU. For more information about this project contact <a class="link" href="http://pkienzle.github.io/">Paul Kienzle</a>.</p>
                <h3 >Transition from Scientist to Programmer</h3>
                <p>After finishing my post-doctoral work I decided to concentrate more on programming. This meant going back to basics to check I did not miss anything in my fragmented learning. A list of courses that I have either completed, started or intend to complete in the future, is <a class="link" href="courses.html">here</a>. This is not an exhaustive list so please contact me if you require more information please contact me using the information at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <h3>First job as a developer</h3>
                <p>Since starting my first position as a junior developer I now have experience with a range of different technologies. I have worked with client and server side Javascript in docker containers deployed in a mesos cluster. While I have not been directly involved in the infrastructure, I have completed small projects that have exposed me to the AWS platform and Ansible as a deployment techique, and the use of Githubs Hubot.</p>
                <p>While the majority of new code was being written in Javascript I also spent time working with the legacy system where the main codebase was in C#, a mixture of .NET web applications and console applications on both IIS6 and IIS8 servers. Also part of this system was a Java app, run as a dockerised container in the mesos cluster. A major part of these systems that I had not previously been exposed to was working with databases, in this case MS-SQL and Postgres.</p>
